# CUSTOMER-CHURN-ANALYSER
# Customer Churn Analyzer

This project is focused on analyzing and predicting **customer churn** using data analytics and machine learning techniques. Customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company) is a key metric for businesses, and understanding it can help organizations take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Project Overview
The notebook walks through the complete machine learning workflow:
- **Data Loading**: Importing and understanding the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing patterns, distributions, and correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- **Model Training**: Building and evaluating classification models to predict churn.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance measurement.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
